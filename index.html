<h3>Left: Our Priorities <br>
Below: Our Story</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a little hungry panda. She wandered upon a strawberry farm. She tasted a berry and found that it was sour.</p>
<p>Even though it was sour, she was starving. With no time to be picky, she chose and ate another berry. It was sweet this time. She ate until she was full, sometimes finding a sour berry, but that didnâ€™t stop her.</p>
<p>The farm owner found her sleeping in a circle of empty vines. Though the owner was upset, but, they found calm in the sight of the adorable sleeping panda. The owner took the panda in and cared for her. They fed her plenty fruits and vegetables and made her a little cabing to live in.</p>
<p>The little panda vowed to help others see that they can continue, even when there is no hope. She founded the PandaTarts club and soon after two more panda came to join her. They went around helping animals and farmers see the light at the end of the tunnel. They became their hope and cheering mascots. </p>
<p>Now they need more people! With your help, they can stretch their services farther and enrich more lives. You will gain adorable allies and a plethora of fruits and veggies. Not to mention valuable connections  with the growers of the world.</p>
